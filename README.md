# BVSVC - The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Decentralized Applications

BVS (Business Value System), a business value system based on blockchain technology, aims to realize the value exchange network of distributed applications and build a cluster of mobile terminal business innovative applications. The overall structure and consensus design of BVS can rapidly promote the commercial circulation of blockchain technology, and people can more efficiently engage in investment, transaction, promotion, trade and other exchange businesses, deeply explore the commercial value of blockchain and realize blockchain 4.0.

## Architecture

BVS adopts a 3-layer architecture divided into Storage Layer, Core Layer, and Application Layer. The BVS protocol adheres to Google Protobuf, which intrinsically supports multi- language extension.

###	Core

There are several modules in the core layer, including smart contracts, account management, and consensus. A stack-based virtual machine is implemented on BVS and an optimized instruction set is used. In order to better support DApp developers, Solidity4 was chosen as the smart contract language, followed by future support of other advanced languages. In addition, BVS's consensus mechanism is based on Delegated Proof of Value (DPoV) and many innovations were made in order to meet its unique requirements.

###	Storage

BVS designed a unique distributed storage protocol consisting of Block Storage and State Storage. The notion of a graph database was introduced into the design of the storage layer to better meet the need for diversified data storage in the real world.

###	Application

Developers can create a diverse range of DApps and customized wallets on BVS. Since BVS enables smart contracts to be deployed and executed, the opportunities of utility applications are unlimited.

###	Protocol

BVS protocol adheres to Google Protocol Buffers5, which is a language-neutral, platform- neutral, and extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more.
